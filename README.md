# 🪙 Crypto Price Prediction

This project is a machine learning-based system to predict cryptocurrency prices using historical data. It applies data preprocessing, visualization, and prediction models to analyze trends and forecast future prices for popular cryptocurrencies.


## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **NumPy & Pandas** - Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning
- **Keras & TensorFlow** - Deep learning model (LSTM)

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Afsar0217/crypto-price-prediction.git
cd crypto-price-prediction
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 How It Works

1. Load historical crypto data (e.g., BTC/USD)
2. Preprocess and normalize it
3. Train the model (e.g., LSTM) on historical time-series data
4. Evaluate and visualize predictions

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Add web interface (Streamlit/Flask)
- Use real-time APIs for live predictions
- Improve model accuracy with more data/features
